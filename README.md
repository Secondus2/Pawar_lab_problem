# Pawar Lab Modelling Exercise - Question 3

# Requirements: Python 3, numpy, scipy and matplotlib

This widget simulates the three-population food chain model described in the Modelling Exercise.

The user can interact with the plot displayed using the toolbar to zoom in and out, save the plot etc., and the drop-down menus to choose which variables to plot.

Users can also change the parameter values by inputting values into the entry boxes, and pressing the "Rerun" button. This will take any new parameter values from the user, while keeping all other parameter values unchanged. It will ignore any values â‰¤ 0.

Each plot will have a red line or dot representing the expected steady state according to my calculations. This assumes that the parameters are suitable for a stable system with all species present.
